# CEP-Project
***Description***
We used a Kaggle dataset to predict future sales and customer reviews for Etsy shops. We analyzed the data and made predictions using tools like Pandas and Scikit-Learn. You can check our findings and insights in this GitHub repository to help Etsy shop owners make better predictions about their sales and customer reviews

we have used these libraries

(***import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
import seaborn as sns***)

we utilize Pandas to handle and manipulate our data, Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative visualizations, Scikit-Learn to construct a predictive model, and metrics such as Mean Squared Error and R-squared to assess the model's accuracy. These tools are like the essential tools in our data analysis and machine learning toolkit, enabling us to understand our data and make informed predictions.
